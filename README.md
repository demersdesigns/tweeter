TWEETER
=================
Tweeter is a simple Twitter viewer demo application. The application allows you to view the latest 15 tweets authored by the last 20 people you followed on Twitter. It is intentionally limited in its feature set and is hardcoded to my personal Twitter account.


About
-----
This application was produced as a proof of concept and thus has a very limited scope. Here are some of the things that were used in its creation:

The HTML5 and CSS3 are based upon the HTML5 Boilerplate project.
+ http://html5boilerplate.com/
 
CSS was written using the LESS framework and compiled using the LESS.app application.
+ Framework: http://lesscss.org/
+ Desktop Compiler: http://incident57.com/less/

The site is modeled with MVVM in mind and utilizes the Knockout.js framework for local model storage as well as templating.
